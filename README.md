# NGS_Onboarding
This respository is designed to help new lab members with on-boarding tasks for Biowulf and NGS analysis in the Batista Lab. 

## Getting Started on Biowulf
1) Request a Biowulf account [here](https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/accounts.html)
2) Once you have an account, request that [@FitzsimmonsCM](https://github.com/FitzsimmonsCM) (our Biowulf admin) add you to the appropriate group directories on Biowulf. 
3) Follow our lab instructions to [update your default permissions](https://hpc.nih.gov/storage/permissions.html), and ensure that you can navigate to the shared directories.
4) Ask [@FitzsimmonsCM](https://github.com/FitzsimmonsCM) or [@BatistaLab](https://github.com/BatistaLab) add you to the lab GitHub.
5) Get started!  

## A Few of Our Favorite Things
We recognize that everyone comes to our lab with different levels of coding experience. To help everyone learn, we've compiled a list of our favorite resources. This list is not meant to be exhaustive, but let us know if you have a favorite resource we can add or if one of the links is broken. 

#### Programming-specific text editors
Using a programming-specific text editor makes it easy to write code acurately without formatting issues. Here are a few text editors that members of our lab use. Try a few and select the one that you like. Importantly--**DON'T USE WORD OR GOOGLE DOCS TO WRITE CODE**
* [Komodo Edit](https://www.activestate.com/products/komodo-edit/)
